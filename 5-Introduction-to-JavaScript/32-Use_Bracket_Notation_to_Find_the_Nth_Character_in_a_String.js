// I learned that with computer notation the computer starts counting at 0 so any time you go to find something you always have to sutract one.




// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];
