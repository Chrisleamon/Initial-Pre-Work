// I learned how to append straings and variables together in short hand.




// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = " cool.";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
